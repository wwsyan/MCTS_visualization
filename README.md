# MCTS_visualization
An implementation of visualizing Monte Carlo Tree Search 

Require: <code>pip install pygame</code>

**Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** is a classic planning algorithm applied in Alphago and AlphaZero.
In this case, a pure MCTS (without value evaluation network) is used but still effective to solve the problem.


Run <code>run.py</code> to play.
